          Open <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> is a
          collection of Open-Source Mapping tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          My goal is to provide free, powerful web applications that make
          Mapping easy and accessible.
        </p>

        <p>
          To do this, I am learning how to make an Open-Source project
          sustainable and figure out a way to get paid for my time working on
          it.

        <h2>What is Open-Source Software?</h2>

        <p class="lead">
          Open-Source software is software that anyone can view, use, and
          modify. Including for commercial purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of being controlled by one company, the code is shared
          publicly so that individuals, communities, and organizations can
          collaborate, improve it, or build on it. This open approach is the
          foundation of much of the modern Internet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many of the tools and technologies behind the websites, apps, and
          services we use every day are built on Open-Source software. For
          example, the Android operating system, the Firefox and Chrome
          browsers, and even the basic building blocks of websites (like HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript) rely heavily on Open-Source contributions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without Open-Source software, the web as we know it wouldn’t exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open-Source software is not just about free software; it’s about
          freedom of choice, collaboration, and innovation. It allows anyone to
          contribute, learn, and benefit from the collective knowledge and
          creativity of the global community.
        </p>

          Thanks to Open-Source software, I have been building things for the
          web both for fun and professionally since 1997. I run an eBay
          advertising service called
          <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/">Auction Nudge</a> and work on
          Open-Source software. Currently the former pays for the later.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open-Source technologies have empowered me (and many others) to create
          and run my own business with almost no startup costs. Using the
          generosity of others to create value for others and a living for
          myself. This is a very powerful concept.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities (especially cycling) and
          my love of the outdoors is what started my journey into GIS.

        <h2>The Master Plan</h2>

        <p class="lead">Getting paid to work "for free".</p>

        <p>
          Being creative, tackling interesting problems and building things that
          add value for others.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, while I have received a lot of positive feedback, the project
          is far from financially sustainable. While I believe in the value of
          Open-Source, the project can only continue if I can figure out an
          income stream.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following my interests in this field, and by learning through
          doing, I have developed a broad understanding of
          <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> technologies on
          the web. By doing this in the open, my software products are gather a
          small, but loyal userbase.

        <h3>Waymark</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          An Open-Source WordPress plugin to easily create, edit and share
          meaningful Maps.
        </p>

        <img
          class="right"
          src="https://www.morehawes.ca/assets/images/home/waymark.jpg"
          width="240px"
        />

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goals</strong>: Figure out how to create and support a
            popular Open-Source WordPress plugin that makes the experience of
            creating Maps an intuative and easy on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Progress</strong>: 1,000+ users, Open-Source participation,
            and a growing community.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Using the popular
          <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library, the plugin
          allows users to create and edit Maps with an intuitive interface.
          Users can add Overlays (Markers, Lines & Shapes) to their Maps and
          style them using Types. Waymark uses
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as the
          default Basemap.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plugin has approximately 1000 users, and all sorts of use-cases
          (from dog walks to transport maps). Users can be grouped as either:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal</strong> websites, bobbyists and bloggers</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organisations</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Activities</strong> (e.g.
                hike/run/bike/kayak/skate/motorcycle)
                <ul>
                  <li>Races/events</li>
                  <li>Clubs/groups/organisations</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Trail</strong> organisations and associations</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tourism</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Communities (cCities/towns/villages)</li>
                  <li>Tour Guides</li>
                  <li>Travel blogs</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Transport</strong> (e.g. public bus/train)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The WordPress plugin is written in PHP and JavaScript. I released the
          JavaScript Editor/Viewer code as a seperate Open-Source project called
          <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, which means
          Waymark can be used by anyone, not just WordPress users.

            </p>

            <p>
              It includes a Map Editor, Viewer and a set of Types that can be

            <h4>The Editor</h4>

            <p>The Editor runs in your web browser and allows you to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Import</b> data from various formats (GPX, KML and

              <li>
                Create <b>Overlays</b> (Markers, Line & Shapes) using the
                intuitive interface
              </li>
              <li>
                Add meaning to your Maps by styling Overlays using <b>Types</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Export</b> your Maps to save them offline, including your
                custom Types.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              No account or API key is required to use the Editor and Maps are
              stored in your browser's local storage.
