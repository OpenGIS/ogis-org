        <h1>What is Open GIS?</h1>

        <p>
          A collection of Open-Source Geographic Information System (GIS) tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open GIS aims to make it easy for anyone to create, edit and share
          <em>Meaningful</em> Maps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently the project consists of some free WordPress
          <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> and a JavaScript library called
          <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, created by me (<a
            href="https://www.morehawes.ca"
            >Joe</a
          >). This software is currently being used to provide interactive Maps
          to website visitors on approximately 1,000 sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide free, Open-Source GIS tools that are easy to use and
            accessible to everyone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create revenue through Pro features and donations to support the
            project. Pro features include:
            <ul>
              <li>Cloud storage for Maps</li>
              <li>Overlay Image hosting</li>
              <li>Collaboration tools</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h1>What is Open-Source Software?</h1>

        <p>
          Open-Source software is software that is made available to the public
          for free, with its source code accessible for anyone to view, use,
          modify, and distribute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open-Source software is often developed collaboratively by a community
          of developers and users who contribute to its improvement and
          maintenance. This collaborative approach allows for rapid innovation,
          transparency, and the ability to adapt software to specific needs.
        </p>

        <!--         <p>
          Much of the software we use on the web is Open-Source, including
          popular projects like:

        <h2>About Joe</h2>

          I have been building things for the web since 1997, both for fun and
          professionally. I run an eBay advertising service called
          <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/">Auction Nudge</a> which does
          the later. You can see my Open-Source contributions on
          <a href="https://github.com/morehawes">GitHub</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Open-Source technologies have empowered me (and many others) to create
          and run my own business with almost no startup costs. Using other
          people's hard work to build new things for free. This is a very
          powerful concept.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities (especially cycling) and
          my love of the outdoors is what started my journey into GIS.
        </p>

        <h3>My Master Plan</h3>

        <p>Getting paid to work "for free".</p>

        <p>
          Being creative, tackling interesting problems and building things that
          add value for others.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, while I have received a lot of positive feedback, the project
          is far from financially sustainable. While I believe in the value of
          Open-Source, the project can only continue if I can figure out an
          income stream.
        </p>

        <p>
          By following my interests in this field, and by learning through
          doing, I have developed a broad understanding of GIS technologies on
          the web. By doing this in the open, my software products are gather a
          small, but loyal userbase.

        <h4>Waymark</h4>

        <img
          class="right"
          src="https://www.morehawes.ca/assets/images/home/waymark.jpg"
          width="300px"
        />

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Goals</strong>: Figure out how to create and support a
            popular Open-Source WordPress plugin that makes the experience of
            creating Maps an intuative and easy on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Progress</strong>: 1,000+ users, Open-Source participation,
            and a growing community.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          An Open-Source WordPress plugin to easily create, edit and share
          meaningful Maps.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using the popular
          <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library, the plugin
          allows users to create and edit Maps with an intuitive interface.
          Users can add Overlays (Markers, Lines & Shapes) to their Maps and
          style them using Types. Waymark uses
          <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as the
          default Basemap.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plugin has approximately 1000 users, and all sorts of use-cases
          (from dog walks to transport maps). Users can be grouped as either:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Personal</strong> websites, bobbyists and bloggers</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Organisations</strong>:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Activities</strong> (e.g.
                hike/run/bike/kayak/skate/motorcycle)
                <ul>
                  <li>Races/events</li>
                  <li>Clubs/groups/organisations</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Trail</strong> organisations and associations</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Tourism</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>Communities (cCities/towns/villages)</li>
                  <li>Tour Guides</li>
                  <li>Travel blogs</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Transport</strong> (e.g. public bus/train)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The WordPress plugin is written in PHP and JavaScript. I released the
          JavaScript Editor/Viewer code as a seperate Open-Source project called
          <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, which means
          Waymark can be used by anyone, not just WordPress users.
        </p>

        <h3>Waymark JS</h3>

        <img
          class="right"
          src="assets/img/waymark-js-editor.jpg"
          width="300px"
        />

        <p>
          <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a> is a JavaScript
          library for creating and editing Maps. It includes a Map Editor,
          Viewer and a set of Types that can be used to add meaning to Overlays.
        </p>

        <h4>The Editor</h4>

        <p>The Editor runs in your web browser and allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Import</b> data from various formats (GPX, KML and
            <a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Create <b>Overlays</b> (Markers, Line & Shapes) using the intuitive
            interface
          </li>
          <li>
            Add meaning to your Maps by styling Overlays using <b>Types</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Export</b> your Maps to save them offline, including your custom
            Types.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          No account or API key is required to use the Editor and Maps are
          stored in your browser's local storage.
        </p>

        <h4>Example</h4>

        <p>
          The following Map Editor is created with a few lines of code. The Map
          state is stored in GeoJSON format, which is updated as the user
          interacts with the Map. View the
          <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js/#quick-start">Documentation</a>
          for more details.

          in the open.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next stage is creating a product or service people are willing to
