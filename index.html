    <h1>What is Open GIS?</h1>

    <p>
      A collection of Open-Source Geographic Information System (GIS) tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open GIS aims to make it easy for anyone to create, edit and share
      <em>Meaningful</em> Maps.
    </p>

    <p>
      Currently the project consists of some free WordPress
      <a href="#plugins">plugins</a> and a JavaScript library called
      <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, created by me (<a
        href="https://www.morehawes.ca"
        >Joe</a
      >). This software is currently being used to provide interactive Maps to
      website visitors on approximately 1,000 sites.
    </p>

    <h2>About Joe</h2>

      I have been building things for the web since 1997, both for fun and to
      put food on the table. I run an eBay advertising service called
      <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/">Auction Nudge</a> which does the
      later.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities (especially cycling) and my
      love of the outdoors is what started my journey into GIS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open-Source technologies have empowered me (and many others) to create and
      run my own business with almost no startup costs. Using other people's
      hard work to build new things for free. This is a very powerful concept.
    </p>

    <h3>My Master Plan</h3>

    <p>Getting paid to work "for free".</p>

    <p>
      Being creative, tackling interesting problems and building things that add
      value for others.
    </p>

    <p>
      So far, while I have received a lot of positive feedback, the project is
      far from financially sustainable. While I believe in the value of
      Open-Source, the project can only continue if I can figure out an income
      stream.
    </p>

    <!-- 
    <p>Open GIS is a free, Open-Source Geographic Information System (GIS).</p>

    <p>
      With no technical knowledge required, users can create, edit, and share
      <em>Meaningful</em> Maps.
    </p>

      You can use the Open GIS Editor at

    <h2>Project Goals</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide free, Open-Source GIS tools that are easy to use and accessible
        to everyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create revenue through Pro features and donations to support the
        project. Pro features include:
        <ul>
          <li>Cloud storage for Maps</li>
          <li>Overlay Image hosting</li>
          <li>Collaboration tools</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Progress</h2>

    <h3>WordPress Plugins</h3>

    <h4>Waymark</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Goals</strong>: Figure out how to create and support a popular
        Open-Source WordPress plugin that makes the experience of creating Maps
        an intuative and easy on.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Progress</strong>: 1,000+ users, Open-Source participation, and
        a growing community.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      An Open-Source WordPress plugin to easily create, edit and share
      meaningful Maps.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plugin has approximately 1000 users, and all sorts of use-cases (from
      dog walks to transport maps). Users can be grouped as either:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal</strong> websites, bobbyists and bloggers</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Organisations</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Activities</strong> (e.g.
            hike/run/bike/kayak/skate/motorcycle)
            <ul>
              <li>Races/events</li>
              <li>Clubs/groups/organisations</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Trail</strong> organisations and associations</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tourism</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Communities (cCities/towns/villages)</li>
              <li>Tour Guides</li>
              <li>Travel blogs</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Transport</strong> (e.g. public bus/train)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The WordPress plugin is written in PHP and JavaScript. I released the
      JavaScript Editor/Viewer code as a seperate Open-Source project called
      <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, which means Waymark
      can be used by anyone, not just WordPress users.
    </p>

    <h3>Waymark JS</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a> is a JavaScript
      library for creating and editing Maps. It includes a Map Editor, Viewer
      and a set of Types that can be used to add meaning to Overlays.
    </p>

    <h4>The Editor</h4>

    <p>The Editor runs in your web browser and allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Import</b> data from various formats (GPX, KML and
        <a href="https://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create <b>Overlays</b> (Markers, Line & Shapes) using the intuitive
        interface
      </li>
      <li>Add meaning to your Maps by styling Overlays using <b>Types</b></li>
      <li>
        <b>Export</b> your Maps to save them offline, including your custom
        Types.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Editor is built with
      <a href="https://github.com/OpenGIS/Waymark-JS">Waymark JS</a>, an Open
      GIS project for creating and editing Maps and uses
      <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as the Basemap.
    </p>

    <p>
      No account or API key is required to use the Editor and Maps are stored in
      your browser's local storage.
    </p>

    <h4>Example</h4>

    <p>
      The following Map Editor is created with a few lines of code. The Map
      state is stored in GeoJSON format, which is updated as the user interacts
      with the Map. View the
      <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js/#quick-start">Documentation</a> for
      more details.
    </p>

    <div id="waymark-map"></div>

    <pre>
<code>
  // Create viewer Instance
  const viewer = window.Waymark_Map_Factory.editor();

  // Initialise with our options
  viewer.init();

  // Load GeoJSON
  viewer.load_json({
    type: "FeatureCollection",
    features: [
      {
        type: "Feature",
        properties: {
          type: "beer",
          title: "The Scarlet Ibis",
          description:
            "Great pub, great food! Especially after a Long Ride üö¥üçîüçüüç∫üç∫üí§",
          image_large_url: "https://www.waymark.dev/assets/geo/pub.jpeg",
        },
        geometry: {
          type: "Point",
          coordinates: [-128.0094, 50.6539],
        },
      },
    ],
  });
</code>
</pre>

    <h2>Lessons so Far</h2>

    <h3>Running an Open-Source Project</h3>

    <p>
      Gathering experience with <a href="https://github.com/OpenGIS">Github</a>,
      by running a project in the open.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next stage is creating a product or service people are willing to pay
      for.
