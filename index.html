          <p class="lead">A collection of Open-Source Mapping tools.</p>

          <p>
            My goal is to provide free, powerful web applications that make
            Mapping easy and accessible.
          </p>

          <p>
            To do this, I am learning how to make an Open-Source project
            sustainable and figure out a way to get paid for my time working on
            it. This is an overview of my progress so far.

          <h2>What is Open-Source Software?</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Open-Source software is software that anyone can view, use, and
            modify. Including for commercial purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of being controlled by one company, the code is shared
            publicly so that individuals, communities, and organizations can
            collaborate, improve it, or build on it. This open approach is the
            foundation of much of the modern Internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of the tools and technologies behind the websites, apps, and
            services we use every day are built on Open-Source software. For
            example, the Android operating system, the Firefox and Chrome
            browsers, and even the basic building blocks of websites (like HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript) rely heavily on Open-Source contributions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without Open-Source software, the web as we know it wouldn’t exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open-Source software is not just about free software; it’s about
            freedom of choice, collaboration, and innovation. It allows anyone
            to contribute, learn, and benefit from the collective knowledge and
            creativity of the global community.
          </p>

            Thanks to Open-Source software, I have been building things for the
            web both for fun and professionally since 1997. I run an eBay
            advertising service called
            <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/">Auction Nudge</a> and work
            on Open-Source software. Currently the former pays for the later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open-Source technologies have empowered me (and many others) to
            create and run my own business with almost no startup costs. Using
            the generosity of others to create value for others and a living for
            myself. This is a very powerful concept.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities (especially cycling) and
            my love of the outdoors is what started my journey into GIS.

          <p class="lead">Getting paid to work "for free".</p>

          <p>
            Being creative, tackling interesting problems and building things
            that add value for others.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far, while I have received a lot of positive feedback, the
            project is far from financially sustainable. While I believe in the
            value of Open-Source, the project can only continue if I can figure
            out an income stream.
          </p>

          <p>
            By following my interests in this field, and by learning through
            doing, I have developed a broad understanding of
            <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> technologies
            on the web. By doing this in the open, my software products are
            gather a small, but loyal userbase.

                <li>
                  <b>Goals</b>: Figure out how to create and support a popular
                  Open-Source WordPress plugin that makes the experience of
                  creating Maps an intuative and easy on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Progress</b>: 1,000+ users, Open-Source participation,
                  growing community.

              </ul>

              <p>
                WordPress is the most popular Content Management System (CMS) in
                the world and currently powers over 40% of
                <b>all</b> websites. It is also Open-Source and has an
                established community.
              </p>

              <p>
                Using the popular
                <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library, the plugin
                allows users to create and edit Maps with an intuitive
                interface. Users can add Overlays (Markers, Lines & Shapes) to
                their Maps and style them using Types. Waymark uses
                <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as
                the default Basemap.
              </p>

              <p>
                The plugin has approximately 1000 users, and all sorts of
                use-cases (from dog walks to transport maps). Users can be
                grouped as either:

              </ul>

              <p>
                The WordPress plugin is written in PHP and JavaScript. I
                released the JavaScript Editor/Viewer code as a seperate
                Open-Source project called
                <a href="https://www.waymark.dev/js">Waymark JS</a>, which means
                Waymark can be used by anyone, not just WordPress users.
              </p>

              <p>
                The plugin has been made better by user contributions
                (feedback/ideas/code/<a

                following languages in addition to English:

              </ul>

              <p>
                Thanks to the WordPress translation community, Waymark is
                becoming more accessible to users around the world.

              <h4>The Editor</h4>

              <p>The Editor runs in your web browser and allows you to:</p>

                <li>

                  Add meaning to your Maps by styling Overlays using

                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                No account or API key is required to use the Editor and Maps are

                />
                A WordPress plugin to display your live Garmin inReach data.
                These satellite communication devices are used for outdoor
                activities, especially in remote areas where cellular coverage
                is not available.
              </p>

              <p>
                The plugin allows the user to embed a Map on their website,
                showing the current location and route of their inReach device.
                The Map is responsive, so it works on both desktop and mobile
                devices and has a number of customisation options.
              </p>

              <p>
                The plugin enables WordPress users to stay connected while they
                are out of cellular coverage, allowing them to share their
                location with friends and family. While Garmin has their own
                tools for this, this plugin makes the process much simpler.

                A mobile app providing offline trail Maps of the Comox Valley
                area in Canada. Available through the browser or through the
                Apple and Android app stores for offline use.
              </p>

              <p>
                The app was dessigned to be simple and only included one button
                - "locate", which uses your device GPS to display your current
                location (and which way you are facing). This is especially
                useful when navigating trails in terrain without cellular
                service.

              <p>
                This project taught me alot about distributing topographical
                maps to users using web technologies, as well as the logistics
