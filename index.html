            To do this, I am learning how to make an Open-Source project

          <h2>What is Open-Source Software?</h2>

          <p class="lead">
            Open-Source software is software that anyone can view, use, and
            modify. Including for commercial purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of being controlled by one company, the code is shared
            publicly so that individuals, communities, and organizations can
            collaborate, improve it, or build on it. This open approach is the
            foundation of much of the modern Internet and software as a whole.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many of the tools and technologies behind the websites, apps, and
            services we use every day are built on Open-Source software. For
            example, the Android operating system, the Firefox and Chrome
            browsers, and even the basic building blocks of websites (like HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript) rely heavily on Open-Source contributions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Without Open-Source software, the web as we know it wouldn’t exist.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open-Source software is not just about free software; it’s about
            freedom of choice, collaboration, and innovation. It allows anyone
            to contribute, learn, and benefit from the collective knowledge and
            creativity of the global community.

            />
            Thanks to Open-Source software, I have been building things for the
            web both for fun and professionally since 1997. I run an eBay
            advertising service called
            <a href="https://www.auctionnudge.com/">Auction Nudge</a> and
            contribute to the Open-Source software. Currently the former pays
            for the later.
          </p>

          <p>
            Open-Source technologies have empowered me (and many others) to
            create and run my own business with almost no startup costs. Using
            the generosity of others to create value for others and a living for
            myself. This is a very powerful concept.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time I enjoy outdoor activities (especially cycling) and
            my love of the outdoors is what started my journey into GIS.

          <h2>The Master Plan</h2>

          <p class="lead">Getting paid to work "for free".</p>

          <p>
            Being creative, tackling interesting problems and building things
            that add value for others.
          </p>

          <p>
            So far, while I have a growing userbase and positive feedback, the
            project is far from financially sustainable. While I believe in the
            value of Open-Source, the project can only continue if I can figure
            out an income stream.
          </p>

          <p>
            By following my interests in this field, and by learning through
            doing, I have developed a broad understanding of
            <abbr title="Geographic Information System">GIS</abbr> technologies
            on the web. By doing this in the open, my software products are
            gathering a small, but loyal userbase.

                  For this project I personally recorded GPS tracks of trails
                  (by running and riding them), overlaying them on top of
                  OpenStreetMap data to create a detailed map of the trails.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I then created a georeferenced map of the area using
                  Photoshop, which combined with the users current loction and
                  heading could be used for navigation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  While the map was never published, the project was a valuable
                  learning experience in creating maps and working with
                  geospatial data.

                  My goal with Waymark was to learn how to create and support a
                  popular Open-Source WordPress plugin that makes the experience
                  of creating Maps an intuative and easy on.
                </p>

                <p>
                  WordPress is the most popular Content Management System (CMS)
                  in the world and currently powers over 43% of
                  <b>all</b> websites. It is also Open-Source and has an
                  established community.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Using the popular
                  <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library, the
                  plugin allows users to create and edit Maps with an intuitive
                  interface. Users can add Overlays (Markers, Lines & Shapes) to
                  their Maps and style them using Types. Waymark uses
                  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> as
                  the default Basemap.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plugin has approximately 1000 users, and all sorts of
                  use-cases (from dog walks to transport maps).
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plugin has been made better by user contributions
                  (feedback/ideas/code/<a
                    href="https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/waymark/"
                    >translations</a
                  >) and is currently <em>officially</em> available in the
                  following languages in addition to English:
                </p>

                <ul>

                </ul>

                <p>
                  Thanks to the WordPress translation community, Waymark is
                  becoming more accessible to users around the world.

                  A mobile app providing offline trail Maps of the Comox Valley
                  regions in British Columbia, Canada. Available through the

                <p>
                  The app was dessigned to be simple and only included one
                  button - "locate", which uses your device GPS to display your
                  current location (and which way you are facing). This is
                  especially useful when navigating trails in terrain without
                  cellular service.

                  A WordPress plugin to display your live Garmin inReach data.
                  These satellite communication devices are used for outdoor
                  activities, especially in remote areas where cellular coverage
                  is not available.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plugin allows the user to embed a Map on their website,
                  showing the current location and route of their inReach
                  device. The Map is responsive, so it works on both desktop and
                  mobile devices and has a number of customisation options.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The plugin enables WordPress users to automatically share
                  their location with friends and family from anywhere in the
                  world. While Garmin has their own tools for this, this plugin
                  makes the process much simpler.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I use this plugin myself to share my location on bikepacking
                  trips, often in remote areas.

                  OSM Highlights is a web-based tool that allows users to

                  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/"> OpenStreetMap</a>
                  data using dynamic style queries. Users can query Vector tiles
                  powered by
                  <a href="https://openfreemap.org/">OpenFreeMap</a> to
                  highlight features by tag, class, or type, creating custom
                  thematic maps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The default query displays trails and some Points of Interest
                  relevant to outdoor recreational activities. Users can edit
                  the default query or import/export custom queries to further
                  customize their maps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The tool includes a debug "spy" feature that allows users to
                  inspect the underlying OSM data of any feature by clicking it
                  on the map. It also provides links to the OSM site using
